# Implementing a Weather and Time Telegram Bot
This project was done as the final project of the Quera's Python LevelUp, and the bot was up and running for several days. It is down since a long time ago but by giving an API key and a bot ID it can be used just as before. The bot gets real-time information from Openweather.com in a .json format and uses that data to inform the users what ever data the need.<br><br>
